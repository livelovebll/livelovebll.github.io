<P>this is my first year at rocky college. I am a transfer student from Los Angeles Pierce college in California. I am a student-Athlete here at rocky. I am on the mens Basketball team; beacause of covid most sports will be played in the same season this school year which is the during the spring semester. If it was a normal year I would try to play Basketball and Soccer or Basketball and Track. It has been tough adjusting to my new life away from home. Some days are harder than orher, but somehow I find a way to continue everyday. Billings has a lot of cool things but it also has its drawbacks. For example, one of the things that i love most about this city is how quiet it is. In LOs Angeles there is always something going on, some kind of noise or distraction. Making it hard to focus at time. Billings is quite the opposite. The quietness of the area makes it easy to really see. By see I don't mean visuals. I mean I'm able to see and appreciate thing like nature, the weather, and the air in ways that could never be done in Los Angeles. At the same time though one of its drawbacks is that it is too quiet, too small. I like the feeling of being being able to go out friday or saturday nights in a big city. being surrounded by differnt types of people and cultures. Knowing the the possiblites of what could be done that night are endless. My name is Kevin Fassu and i just wrote a short quick comparision of my old home and my new home because i was bored.</P>
